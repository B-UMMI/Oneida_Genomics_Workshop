# Target audience:
Researchers with interest in high throughput sequence data analysis in the context of microbial pathogens and willing to analyse their own data
 
# Pre-requisites:
The course will be taught based using command line in Linux environment , so previous knowledge of Linux basics is required.

# Course Objectives
 
The objectives of the training course are to provide a hands-on tutorial to ONEIDA members of the bioinformatics software being developed and used within the scope of ONEIDA.
 
The workshop will be opened to 20 participants, members of laboratories and groups participating in ONEIDA.
 
Participants will use provided datasets or their own data sets to apply the different analytical pipelines that will be presented and results will be discussed among faculty and participants.
