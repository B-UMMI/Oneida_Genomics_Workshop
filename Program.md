# Target audience:
Researchers with a strong interest in high throughput sequence data analysis in the context of microbial pathogens, that have a present or upcoming data analysis problem in their hands.
 
# Pre-requisites:
The Linux environment will be used in all the sessions. 
<br>Familiarity with Linux basics is required, at the level of basic command structure, file system navigation, redirection, piping, etc.
<br>Entry level bioinformatics knowledge will be very handy, not really required-

# Workshop Objectives
The main objectives of the workshop are:
<br>- to provide a hands-on tutorial on the software that is being developed and already in use in the scope of ONEIDA.
<br>- to provide an update on current plans in software development for ONEIDA 

# User data
Participants will be using datasets that have been prepared for demonstration purposes
<br>Participants will be allowed to bring their data sets, and test the different analytical pipelines.
<br>Interesting results will be discussed amongst the workshop participants.

May 4th
Morning  (9:30 – 12:30)
 
1.     Studying microbial diversity with QIIME2:
·      Pre-processing of sequences: remove primers and barcodes, demultiplex
samples
·      Quality filtering, denoising and picking of features and representative
sequences with DADA2 and Deblur
·      Assign taxonomy to features with trained classifiers.
·      Align sequences and infer phylogeny.
·      Calculate alpha and beta diversity.
·      Test for differential abundances between groups of samples using ANCOM and gneiss

Lunch (12h30 – 13h30)

Afternoon (14h00 – 17h00)

2.     Evaluating differential expression with RNA-Seq approaches
·       Aligning RNA-Seq reads to the genome using Hisat2
·       Generating Gene Counts from alignments using featureCounts
· Performing differential expression analysis using DESeq2
